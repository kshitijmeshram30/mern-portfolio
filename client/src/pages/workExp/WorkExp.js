                I meticulously devised a comprehensive plan for the Kapital Data website, overseeing every aspect of its development. Bringing the vision to fruition, I constructed the website from the ground up on HubSpot, incorporating engaging landing pages and polished website sections to enhance Kapital Data's online presence.

A commitment to cross-device excellence was upheld, with responsive design for both web and mobile platforms. Additionally, I created compelling email templates for impactful marketing campaigns. The journey continues with an exciting new projectâ€”a meticulously planned Internal Hiring Website. Currently in the blueprint stage, I've visualized the user journey through wireframes and opted for the robust MERN stack to guarantee a powerful and scalable solution.
